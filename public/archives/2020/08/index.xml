      <description>Overlap lets you compare time zones across multiple locations and quickly find a time that&amp;rsquo;s reasonable in everyone&amp;rsquo;s workday. For me this comes in handy when I&amp;rsquo;m working with colleagues in other time zones, and especially when setting up interviews with users on the other side of the world.
Timezone scrolling  Once you add the locations you need, scrolling right or left moves forward or backward in time across all of them simultaneously.</description>
