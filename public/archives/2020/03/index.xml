      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one to make to-do lists. I jot down thoughts in a notebook, and over the years when I needed a list I&amp;rsquo;ve relied on the Notes app in iOS. It&amp;rsquo;s straightforward, comes bundled with my phone and has done the job. In the past few months my work and personal life got quite busy and I found myself frustrated with Notes. I wanted a free, dead simple to-do app where I could file away the little tasks I was keeping in my head all day.</description>
