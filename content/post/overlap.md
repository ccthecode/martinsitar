Overlap lets you compare time zones across multiple locations and quickly find a time that's reasonable in everyone's workday. For me this comes in handy when I'm working with colleagues in other time zones, and especially when setting up interviews with users on the other side of the world.

## Timezone scrolling

Once you add the locations you need, scrolling right or left moves forward or backward in time across all of them simultaneously. The visual design of the tiles makes them easy to scan, but my favourite detail is the clever use of background colour to indicate a strong or weak workday overlap (which can be defined). As you adjust time, the background colour of each tile shifts. A consistent colour means you've found a time that works well with everyone's workday or falls outside of it. This really helps you spot outliers, especially if you're scanning through a longer list of regions.
